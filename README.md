### Description of the problem: 

- Job functions and job titles are very different things.

- A job title is essentially the name of a position within an organization filled by an employee. 

- Job function is the routine set of tasks or activities undertaken by a person in that position. 

- An employee's title and function are often closely related, though not all job functions are clear based on title alone.


### Create this script as aRESTful API service in which:
- the input is a HTTP request with a parameter for the "Job title".

- theoutput is the recommended “jobfunction/s”. 

### Use Flask API to deploy the RESTful API service. 

**Run the file 02_Code.py to see result of work**
